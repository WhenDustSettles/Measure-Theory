# Measure-Theory
Notes for the course MA550 : Measure Theory during Spring 21 taught by Prof. Pratyoosh Kumar.


There are, however, still few proofs which I need to typset from my notebook and the complete discussion on the Riesz Representation (final topic of the course) which I will add later.

A great course, will recommend!
